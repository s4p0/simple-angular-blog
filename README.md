# My Simple Blog

Created using Angular and AWS SAM

To start using this, change this `src/environments/environment.ts`:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: '<your api here>'
};
```

# Updates

I'll try to keep up with the changes I will be doing for my personal use. Also, this will be used to track my learning in Angular (and AWS SAM, in another repo [here])

#

### Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
